A Podfile is provided which will point to the latest version of the SDK available from github. Note that this may or may not build--that depends on if the version of the sample app checked out matches the latest SDK version on github, but is provided as an example of how to configure a Podfile project with the Keen SDK.

Also note that when running bin/simulate_travis.sh a Podfile is generated that points to the local git repository and current local git branch, as well as a Podfile.lock that does the same.
